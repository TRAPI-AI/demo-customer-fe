## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Requests
- lxml
- Flask-CORS

### Backend Setup

#### Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Ensure the SSL certificate file is in the correct path:**
    Place the `combined_unencrypted.pem` file in the root directory of your project.

4. **Run the Flask app:**
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

    The backend server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

#### Running Remotely

1. **Deploy the Flask app to a cloud service provider (e.g., Heroku, AWS, GCP):**
    Follow the specific instructions of the cloud service provider to deploy a Flask application.

2. **Ensure the SSL certificate file is correctly configured on the server.**

### Frontend Setup

#### Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the frontend app:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

    The frontend server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Running Remotely

1. **Deploy the frontend app to a cloud service provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify):**
    Follow the specific instructions of the cloud service provider to deploy a frontend application.

## Testing Options

1. **Integration Tests:**
    - The integration tests are located in the `integration_tests.py` file.
    - To run the tests, use the following command:
        ```sh
        python integration_tests.py
        ```

## Troubleshooting Guide

1. **Common Issues:**
    - **SSL Certificate Error:**
        - Ensure the `combined_unencrypted.pem` file is in the correct path and is accessible.
    - **CORS Issues:**
        - Ensure that Flask-CORS is properly configured in the backend.
    - **API Request Failures:**
        - Check the network connectivity and ensure the SilverRail API endpoint is correct.
        - Verify the XML payload being sent to the SilverRail API.

2. **Debugging Tips:**
    - Use `print` statements or a debugger to trace the flow of data and identify where issues may be occurring.
    - Check the server logs for any error messages or stack traces.
